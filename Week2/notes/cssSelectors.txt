All selectors and their specificity

Specificity hierarchy
CSS has a set of rules that it uses to ‘score’ or assign a certain weight to selectors and this creates a specificity hierarchy.
Based on the weights, there are four categories in this hierarchy: 
- Inline styles 
- IDs 
- Classes, attributes, and pseudo-classes 
- Elements and pseudo-elements
